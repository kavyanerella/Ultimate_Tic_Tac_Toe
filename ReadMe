Ultimate Tic Tac Toe 

Rules for the game can be found at this site:

Implementation details : 
A tree of all the next possible moves in the game is built dynamically upto a depth of 9. A heuristic function is written to evaluate the value of a state of the board. This value is propagated upwards and so the bot chooses the most optimal move.
